# Openpose

This code is an example of how to use the OpenPose library in Python to perform pose estimation on an image. It detects and highlights key points of a person's body in the image, such as the nose, eyes, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. It also draws lines between these key points to outline the person's pose.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Import necessary libraries: The code imports the required libraries, including OpenCV (`cv2`), NumPy (`np`), and `cv2_imshow` from the Google Colab patches.

2. Define body parts and pose pairs: The code defines a dictionary called `BODY_PARTS` that maps body part names to unique IDs and a list called `POSE_PAIRS` that defines pairs of body parts used to draw lines between them.

3. Load the pre-trained OpenPose model: The code loads a pre-trained OpenPose model from a TensorFlow file (`graph_opt.pb`) using OpenCV's `cv2.dnn.readNetFromTensorflow` function.

4. Set parameters: The code sets some parameters, such as the threshold for confidence in body part detection, the dimensions for resizing the input image (`image_width` and `image_height`), and the input image itself (`img`).

5. Forward pass through the network: The input image is preprocessed and passed through the network using the `net.setInput` method.

6. Process the network output: The code processes the network's output, which includes heatmaps for body parts. It iterates through the body parts, finds the maximum confidence point in each heatmap, and converts the coordinates back to the original image size.

7. Draw body parts and lines: For each pair of body parts defined in `POSE_PAIRS`, the code checks if both body parts are detected with confidence above the threshold. If so, it draws a line connecting them and adds red ellipses at each body part's location.

8. Display the output: The code uses `cv2_imshow` to display the annotated image with detected body parts and pose lines.

9. Wait for user input and close windows: The code waits for the user to press any key (necessary to avoid Colab kernel crashes when using `cv2_imshow`). Once a key is pressed, it closes all open windows.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to perform pose estimation on an image using the OpenPose model and visualize the results by drawing lines and ellipses on the image.
